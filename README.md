# MyProjects
These projects are made around 2 years ago.
The newest one is MyClass, which I have started and continued improving up to now, because it is the way I learn new concepts like reflection, serialization, etc.
I have some other things to show, but all of them have some issues with running (it might be due to the fact that they have been made on Visual C# 2010).
